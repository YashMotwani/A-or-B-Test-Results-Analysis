# Analyze A/B Test Results


## Introduction

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists.

In this project, work is done to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The goal is to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer through the analysis report so that they are able to make their decision.
